# This is a separate workflow to minimize exposure to the risk of enabling write permission on the GitHub Token
# The Gradle dependency graph is generated by various builds in the main workflow,
# which we're limiting to read permissions only. Therefore the dependency graph must be 
# submitted using a separate workflow with write permissions.
# This also enables submissions to happen in PRs from forked repos.
