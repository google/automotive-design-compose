## Introduction

Automotive Design for Compose (also called DesignCompose in the source) is an extension to [Jetpack Compose](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose) that allows every screen, component, and overlay of your Android App to be defined in [Figma](https://www.figma.com), and lets you see the latest changes to your Figma design in your app, immediately!

To use Automotive Design for Compose in an app, a developer specifies the Composables that theyâ€™d like to be defined by Figma, and a designer uses Figma to draw them. Most Figma features, including Auto Layout, Interactions, Variants, and Blend Modes are fully supported. This repo includes the DesignCompose library, an interactive tutorial app (in reference-apps/Tutorial), and a sample customizable Media Center for Android Automotive OS (in reference-apps/aaos-unbundled).

## Getting Started

The DesignCompose Tutorial app shows you the capabilities of DesignCompose through a series of interactive examples.  You will need a Figma account and [personal access token](https://google.github.io/automotive-design-compose/docs/live-update/setup) to view the Tutorial Figma file and a large-screen device to run it on.

You'll work with your own copy of the [Tutorial Figma file](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1228110686419863535/Tutorial-for-Automotive-Design-for-Compose). Create your own by clicking **Open in Figma**, which creates a copy of the file in your account. Once open, identify the Figma Document ID from your new file's URL. It's the alphanumeric string between `file/` and the name of the document. For example:

<pre><code>figma.com/file/<b>ABCDEFG123</b>/File-name</code></pre>

The app's Gradle project is located in `reference-apps/tutorial`. Build and launch it on your device, then set your Figma Access Token on the app by running:

```shell
./gradlew setFigmaTokenDebug
```

Next, switch the app to use your copy of the Tutorial file by clicking the dropdown arrow in the upper right. This will open the Design Switcher.

Click the **Change** button to switch document IDs, and enter the ID of your copy of the Tutorial Figma File. Click **Load** and the app will start fetching your file (it'll take about a minute)

While that's loading, open your copy of the Tutorial file on Figma and find the **Getting Started** box (it's at the top with a pointer pointing to it).

## Building your own app

We'll be adding more documentation and guides soon! For now you can look to `reference-apps/helloworld` for an an example of a basic app.

# Working with the Source

## SDK build dependencies

DesignCompose's Live Update system uses a native library built in Rust to fetch and serialize your Figma Documents. You'll need the following to build it and the rest of the SDK.

### Android Studio

Currently testing with Android Studio Flamingo | 2022.2.1

### Android NDK

Version `25.2.9519653` is required. It can be installed via [Android Studio's SDK Manager](https://developer.android.com/studio/projects/install-ndk#specific-version) or on the command line using the `sdkmanager` binary.

```shell
"${ANDROID_HOME}/cmdline-tools/latest/bin/sdkmanager" --install "ndk;25.2.9519653"
```

### Rust

Rust 1.68.0 is required to compile DesignCompose's Live Update service. Install at [rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs/). For working with the code, we recommend the `rust-analyzer` plugins for VS Code and Android Studio / IntelliJ.

Android Studio will not pick up on a new Rust install without restarting the IDE. In addition, if you launch Android Studio via desktop shortcut or similar (i.e. not from the command line), then it still may not detect the install. In this case you can log out of your computer and back in, or simply restart your computer.

### Rust Toolchains

The DesignCompose library includes a Rust JNI library, which requires Rust build target toolchains. Install them by running the following from the root of the repository

```shell
./install-rust-toolchains.sh
```

## Source Layout

Automotive Design for Compose consists of several components:

- The Jetpack Compose renderer of Automotive Design for Compose documents consists of several modules:

  - `annotation` contains the Kotlin annotation definitions like `@DesignDoc` and `@DesignComponent`.

  - `codegen` contains the Kotlin compiler plugin that processes the annotations and generates stub Composables that use the Automotive Design for Compose runtime.

  - `designcompose` contains the code that interprets Automotive Design for Compose documents and renders them using Jetpack Compose. It also contains the code that uses the Figma Import JNI library to fetch documents from the Figma webservice.

- Figma Import, in `crates/figma_import`, is a library implemented in Rust that fetches documents and resources from the Figma API and generates a serialized document containing only the information that Automotive Design for Compose needs. The JNI interface used by the Android runtime is in `crates/live_update`.

- Figma plugins that give designers more control and a better experience using Figma with Automotive Design for Compose:

  - The Extended Layout Plugin, in `support-figma/extended-layout-plugin` , provides a panel for formatting text, a panel to provide a JSON file with keyword details, a panel to validate keyword usages against the provided JSON file, and a command to sync Figma's prototype settings to the main document.

  - Auto Content Preview Widget, in `support-figma/auto-content-preview-widget` provides a Figma widget that uses the JSON file and allows designers to create and preview complex list layouts.

- A Validation app in `integration-tests/validation` is used for visually validating changes

- The Tutorial app in `reference-apps/tutorial` provides an overview of DesignCompose

- The `reference-apps/aaos-unbundled` directory contains a separate Gradle project that includes demonstrations of DesignCompose with Android Automotive OS Apps, such as a MediaCenter app.

## Building additional resources

### Building the Automotive Design for Compose Figma Plugin and Widget

The DesignCompose Plugin and Auto Content Preview widget are needed to enable additional layout options and features. The latest releases are available in the Figma Community and on our [Figma Community profile](https://www.figma.com/@designcompose). To build and install an older or customized version, follow these instructions:

You can build on any system, but Figma only supports plugin installation via the [Figma Desktop App](https://www.figma.com/downloads/), which only runs on macOS and Windows.

There are two packages that are needed, the Extended Layout plugin and Auto Content Preview widget. Both are located in the `support-figma` directory. Build each by running the following: (you'll need `nodejs` and `npm` installed on your system)

```shell
npm install
npm run build
```

Then open the Figma Desktop app, go to **Plugins** -> **Development** -> **Import plugin from Manifest** and select the `manifest.json` file to import.

# Development process

## Updating serialized Figma files

Any changes that include an update to the Figma serialized file version (set in crates/figma_import/src/serialized_document.rs) will require the committed serialized files to be updated with new versions that have been fetched with the updated version. At a minimum this includes any files that are being tested with AndroidIntegratedTests, and most especially the Tutorial's welcome screen, which is a special case.

The Tutorial's DesignDoc is set to the main development Figma file, to assist in development of the app, but the committed serialized file is a separate file that presents a "welcome" page. This file's ID is `BX9UyUa5lkuSP3dEnqBdJf`. To update the file, fetch the `BX9UyUa5lkuSP3dEnqBdJf` file, then replace `reference-apps/tutorial/app/src/main/assets/figma/TutorialDoc_3z4xExq0INrL9vxPhj9tl7` with the serialized file. **The file name will remain the same**, the `TutorialDoc_3z4xExq0INrL9vxPhj9tl7` fill will contain the serialized `BX9UyUa5lkuSP3dEnqBdJf` file. The Tutorial app project has an AndroidIntegratedTest to ensure that the correct file is set, and it will be run as part of running the `./dev-scripts/test-all.sh` script.

## Testing the standalone version of the Tutorial app

The Tutorial app is currently part of two projects: The root project in the root of the repository, and the tutorial project in `reference-apps/tutorial`. The root project is the one that contains the entire SDK and our apps and is where you typically develop. The second project is the one that users following the Tutorial are directed to use. It fetches DesignCompose from gMaven, which means that it builds much faster and doesn't compile rust code (and doesn't require the rust SDK to be installed). This means that the standalone Tutorial needs some extra configuration if you want the standalone Tutorial project to use any unpublished changes to the libraries and plugin.

First, set `$ORG_GRADLE_PROJECT_DesignComposeMavenRepo` to a location such as ~/.m2repo/designComposeRepo. This will set the location for the SDK and Plugin to be built to and where the Tutorial all will read them from. Run  `./gradlew publishAllPublicationsToLocalDirRepository` to build the SDK and plugin to that location.

Now you can use the `reference-apps/local-design-compose-repo.init.gradle.kts` init script to tell the Tutorial app where to find the libraries that you built. The script reads `ORG_GRADLE_PROJECT_DesignComposeMavenRepo` and uses it to configure Gradle to look for the libraries and plugin from there. You run init scripts by adding `--init-script <path to script>` to your Gradle command. For example, `./gradlew --init-script ../local-design-compose-repo.init.gradle.kts assembleDebug`.

NOTE: Android Studio doesn't have a great way to use init scripts. You'll have to build and use the Tutorial app using the command line. That's fine for quick tests. Any actual development should be done with the proper root Gradle project, which doesn't need the init script.

## Running all tests

The `./dev-scripts/test-all.sh` script will trigger all tests in the repo. This script must pass before a release candidate can be cut.

### Prerequisites

- Make sure your system can run Android AVDs
- Have the build dependencies below installed
- Check out the current supported branch of the AAOS Unbundled repo (see the "Check out the Unbundled AAOS Repo" job in `.github/workflows/main` for the correct branch)
- Set `$FIGMA_ACCESS_TOKEN` to your Figma token

The test-all script takes an optional `-s` flag to skip all emulator tests. It's intended for situations where emulators can't be started or when running tests before updating serialized files.

## Before you submit for review

To check that you can pass presubmits and emulator tests before pushing to PR you can do the following:

  ```shell
  ./dev-scripts/clean-all.sh #Optional, but will ensure you're testing a clean environment.
  ./dev-scripts/format-all.sh
  ./dev-scripts/test-all.sh
  ```

## Release process

1. Create a new release in GitHub, set the tag to "v\<version>" (see previous releases for examples). This will trigger a release build action. \
        You can watch it's progress [here](https://github.com/google/automotive-design-compose/actions/workflows/release.yml).
2. Once complete the release artifacts will be uploaded to the GitHub release automatically
3. Stage the SDK
    1. On a Google workstation, download the designcompose_m2repo.zip from the release and copy it to `/x20/teams/designcompose/release_staging/`
    2. Run gmaven_publisher to stage it:

        ```bash
        /google/bin/releases/android-devtools/gmaven/publisher/gmaven-publisher stage --gfile /x20/teams/designcompose/release_staging/<the m2repo.zip>
        ```

    3. The staged release will be available for additional testing (see go/gmaven for more info). You will receive an email explaining how the release can be submitted for publishing and then approval. The release will be published publicly immediately after approval
4. Update the widget and plugin
    1. Download the widget and plugin artifacts from the GitHub release onto a system with the Figma Desktop app and unzip them
    2. Open the Desktop app and open any doc
    3. Update the Plugin
        1. Open the **Resources** menu(right of the `T` text menu) and switch to the **Plugins** tab
        2. Change the dropdown under the search bar to **Development**
        3. If you already have an entry for the plugin then hover over it, click the `...` menu and click **Remove local version**
        4. The plugin will now have a **Locate local version** option, click it, then navigate to the `manifest.json` of the plugin artifact you downloaded from GitHub
        5. Click the `...` menu again and click Publish. Add any release notes and click **Publish new version**
    4. Do the same as above for the widget (except use the widget menu)
5. Update the Tutorial
    1. Open the Tutorial Figma File and create a new branch
    2. Find each instance of the widget and replace it with the newly published version, matching the settings to the current one
    3. Merge the Tutorial branch into the main branch.
    4. Create a new branch of the Tutorial file named after version you're releasing
    5. From the original file, click the **Share** button in the upper right, switch to the **Publish** tab of the window that pops up and **Publish update**
    6. Make any changes necessary, then click **Save**
