## DesignCompose Extensions {#Extensions}

- Live Update \
    DesignCompose checks for updates from Figma every 5 seconds and automatically re-renders the changes.

- Design Switcher \
    The Design Switcher shows up in the upper right corner of a DesignCompose app. It shows live update details and lets you change the current Figma document.

### Plugins

- Text Eliding & Max Line Count \
    Fine grained text control; hoping to retire this since Figma recently extended their native text capabilities.
- Lists & Grids \
    Flexible layout for complex (and very long) list data.
- Dials & Gauges \
    Create dials & gauges of different kinds by applying values to arcs, rects, and performing translations.
- Localization Tool \
    Pull the string out of the figma design and generates a strings xml file.
