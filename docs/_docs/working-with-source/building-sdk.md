# Build the SDK from source

This page outlines how to download and build the Automotive Design for Compose
source.
## Install required dependencies {#InstallDependencies}

Additional dependencies are required to compile the SDK.

### Android Studio {#AndroidStudio}

The source requires Android Studio Flamingo or later.

### Android NDK {#AndroidNDK}

Version `25.2.9519653` is required. You can install the NDK with Android
Studio's SDK Manager or on the command line using the sdkmanager binary:

```shell
"${ANDROID_HOME}/cmdline-tools/latest/bin/sdkmanager" \
    --install "ndk;25.2.9519653"
```

### Rust {#InstallRust}

Rust 1.63.0 is required to compile DesignCompose's Live Update service.
Installation instructions are on the [Rust installer
page](https://rustup.rs){:.external}.

To complete the Rust installation the Android Studio IDE must be aware of the
new install. There are many ways to do this, but the simplest way to do this is to reboot your computer.

### Rust toolchains {#RustToolchains}

The DesignCompose library includes a Rust JNI library, which must be compiled
for multiple system types. Install the toolchains that DesignCompose needs by
running the following:

```shell
rustup target add \
    armv7-linux-androideabi \
    i686-linux-android \
    aarch64-linux-android \
    x86_64-linux-android
```

## Check out the code {#GetSource}

To check out the code, run the following:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/google/automotive-design-compose.git
```

## Build the code {#BuildCode}

Instructions are provided for building DesignCompose and it's reference apps
using both Android Studio and the command line. The examples below describe how
to build the Tutorial app.

### Android Studio {#BuildInAndroidStudio}

To build the code in Android Studio:

1.  Open the root of the DesignCompose repository in Android Studio.

    Android Studio syncs with the code and populates the **run configurations**
    menu with entries for each of the included apps.

1.  Build the Tutorial app using either the basic or advanced instructions in
    [Build and run your app](https://developer.android.com/studio/run) The Tutorial app is listed in the
    **run configurations** menu as `reference-apps:tutorial`.

### Command line {#BuildWithCommandLine}

To build the code from the command line:

1.  Set the Android SDK location in one of these two ways:

    *   Create `local.properties` in the root of the repository and then set the
    `sdk.dir property` it contains. Android Studio can do this automatically
        when opening a project. For example, use `sdk.dir=$HOME/Android/Sdk`.

    *   Set the `ANDROID_SDK_ROOT` environment variable with the path to the
        Android SDK.

1.  Open a command prompt or a shell window.

1.  Go to the root of the DesignCompose repository.

1.  Run the following command:

    ```shell
    ./gradlew reference-apps:tutorial:assembleDebug
    ```

    The apps are built in the normal build output directories. For example, the
    Tutorial app's debug variant are located in
    `reference-apps/tutorial/build/outputs/apk/debug/tutorial-debug.apk`
