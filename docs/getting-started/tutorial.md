<img src="./tutorial-doc-1x.png" class="attempt-right" srcset="1x ./tutorial-doc-1x.png, 2x ./tutorial-doc-2x.png">

This page explains how to download and configure the DesignCompose tutorial app.
This is written as a tutorial, so it's important to follow each step.

## About this tutorial {:#about}

The DesignCompose tutorial app shows you the capabilities of DesignCompose
through a series of interactive examples. You need a Figma account to run the
tutorial and a large-screen device to run it on.

## Initial setup {:#InitialSetup}

1.  Acquire an Android device or emulator with a large, portrait-orientation
    screen. If you don't have a physical device handy then you can use a virtual
    device (Android emulator) in Android Studio. We recommend a Nexus 10 device
    (in the Tablet category), running the Android 12 (API 31) release system
    image with the startup orientation set to Portrait.

1.  DesignCompose is only available as source. Follow the instructions in
    [Getting Started](/automotive/customize/designcompose/getting-started/index)
    to download the source and install the required development tools.

1.  The tutorial uses the Live Update feature to synchronize with your Figma
    files. Follow the instructions in [Set Up Figma
    Authentication](/automotive/customize/designcompose/live-update/setup) to
    create a Figma authentication token and be ready to use it.

## Create your copy of the Figma tutorial file {:#CopyTutorialFile}

The tutorial app demonstrates how you can modify a Figma design and see the
results in your running Android app. First, create your own copy of the file to
work with:

1.  Go to the [published Tutorial design file](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1228110686419863535/Tutorial-for-Automotive-Design-for-Compose){:.external}
    and if necessary, log in to your Figma account.

1.  Click **Open in Figma** to create your own copy of the file.

1.  Wait for your copy of the file to open, then note the **Figma Document ID**
    in the URL between `file/` and the name of the document.

    For example, the **ID** of the document at
    `https://www.figma.com/file/aabbccdd/Tutorial` is `aabbccdd`.

## Launch and configure the tutorial {:#LaunchTutorial}

1.  Build and launch the tutorial app on your device. You can do this with
    [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/run){:.external} or
    manually using Gradle.

1.  Set your Figma access token in the app by running the `./gradlew
    :reference-apps:tutorial:setFigmaTokenDebug` task.

    *   The task reads the token from the `$FIGMA_ACCESS_TOKEN` environment
        variable that was set in [Store Your Figma Access
        Token](/automotive/customize/designcompose/live-update/setup#StoreFigmaToken).

    *   Alternatively, you can set the token in one command by running:

    ```posix-terminal
    FIGMA_ACCESS_TOKEN=<YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN> \
        ./gradlew :reference-apps:tutorial:setFigmaTokenDebug
    ```

1.  Use the Design Switcher to load your version of the tutorial file.

    *   Click the dropdown arrow in the upper right corner of the tutorial app
        to open the Live Update Design Switcher panel. It should display *Design
    Switcher Online* if your key was set correctly in the previous step.

        **Figure 3.** The Design Switcher settings button.

    *   Click the **Change** button to switch document IDs, entering the ID for
    your copy of the Figma tutorial file .

    *   Click **Load**.  It takes about a minute to do the initial sync.

While thatâ€™s loading, open your copy of the tutorial file on Figma and find the
Getting Started box.
