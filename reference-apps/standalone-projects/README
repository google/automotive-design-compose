# Standalone projects

Contained in here are each of our reference / sample / etc. apps that we intend to release as standalone reference projects. Meaning they'll be separate release artifacts, separate gradle projects and will rely on the released DesignCompose maven artifacts.

The majority of each project's directory are symlinks to other files in our repo. For example, `reference-apps/aaos-unbundled/standalone-project/mediacompose` has symlinks to the actual `media` and `mediacompose` submodules in aaos-unbundled, the `unbundled-settings.gradle.kts` file which brings in the Unbundled apps project, `gradle/libs.versions.toml`, and so-on.

The `export-standalone-project.py` script is used to create the releasable standalone project. It simply copies the directory to a given location, filtering out unnecessary files (`build/`, `local.properties`, etc), and dereferencing the symlinks as it goes. The result should be ready to release and build.
